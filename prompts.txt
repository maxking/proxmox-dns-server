Create a new Go project which is expected to run as an authoritative DNS server 
for a provided zone that is given during the startup. The DNS server is meant
to resolve DNS names based on VM or LXC container name and id both.

Example:

zone p01.araj.me

This server should resolve

102.p01.araj.me to container or VM with id 102.
name.p01.araj.me to container or VM with id 102.


It is expected to run on the same node as proxmox and has
permission to run `pct` command inside containers or `qm`
command to get the details about the IP address.

There might be multiple IP address for each of them, we
need to resolve to only IPv4 address starting with 192.168.
since they are the only internal addresses.
